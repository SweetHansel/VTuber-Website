# Welcome!

Hi! I'm SweetHansel and this project is a kind of fan-project(?) for a VTuber blog/ gallery/ model showcase etc. with a CMS.

Next.js, PayloadCMS (neon's Postgres), Vercel Blob storage, Tailwind, Framer Motion, deployment on Vercel
sweethansel.com (currently running on vercel hobby plan)

## Disclaimer!!
I used Claude to help code and deploy this thing, do with that information as you will... I don't know how much ownership matters in this case, but hey, feel free to use the code as you want!

(Even the idea isn't mine lol, all credits to RaeLaveire)

- For the currerntly running site: I'm not an artist, don't complain.
