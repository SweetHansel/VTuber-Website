# Welcome!

Hi! I'm SweetHansel and this project is a kind of fan-project(?) for a VTuber blog/ gallery/ model showcase etc. with a CMS.

Next.js, PayloadCMS (neon's Postgres), Vercel Blob storage, Tailwind, Framer Motion, deployment on Vercel
sweethansel.com (currently running on vercel hobby plan)

For the moment I'm running a migrate:fresh while in development, dropping all the changes made whenever I'm updating, so any changes from the admin panel will be temporary. (Will change if there's any plan to go to Production)

## Disclaimer!!
I used Claude to help code and deploy this thing, do with that information as you will... I don't know how much ownership matters in this case, but hey, feel free to use the code as you want!

(Even the idea isn't mine lol, all credits to RaeLaveire)

- For the currerntly running site: I'm not an artist, don't complain.
